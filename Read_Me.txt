Hi QA Team, 

Welcome to the Katalon GitHub Repository!

About the Project:
The project was initiated on behalf of the QA Team, specifically automation, to automate specific test cases.
The focus; however, from a manual perspective will be to focus on any test cases, within TestRail, that
have a pririoty of 3 or 4. 

Here's some good to know things:
1. Always make sure to Fetch Origin before you start working to ensure that you have the latest "build"
available on your local from the master branch.
2. If you make any changes on Katalon, please make sure to save your work first for the changes to reflect and then only will it populate under 
"Changes" on GitHub Desktop. 
3. Add a "Commit Message" and  Description to let us know what you've done.
4. Once you've done that, click on the "Commit to master" button located on the bottom left. 
5. You'll have time to review any changes specific on the information pane which will be specific to the item you've selected to the "Changes" tab. 
6. Test Change
